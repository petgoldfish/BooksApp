# Books App

## Implemented:
* Best sellers and details activity
* Nothing else because API documentation is inaccessible :(

## Issues faced:
* Had to attend college during the entire hackathon so, shortage of time
* Had 4 hours of power cut everyday
* The question was vague and not straight to the point and was also spread across the hints and notes ?? :/
* The API documentation was inaccessible and thus there was no way to fetch data from it in the app

I've done the best I could though! Even though only 20% of the app is complete, I still feel I learned a lot from this hackathon!
I hope my criticism will not be taken personally or to heart. I apologise in advance.
